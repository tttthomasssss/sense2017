  abstract  = {In this paper, we investigate whether an a priori disambiguation of word senses
	is strictly necessary or whether the meaning of a word in context can be
	disambiguated through composition alone. We evaluate the performance of
	off-the-shelf single-vector and multi-sense vector models on a benchmark phrase
	similarity task and a novel task for word-sense discrimination. We find that
	single-sense vector models perform as well or better than multi-sense vector
	models despite arguably less clean elementary representations. Our findings
	furthermore show that simple composition functions such as pointwise addition
	are able to recover sense specific information from a single-sense vector model
	remarkably well.},
